Upward social mobility is a pertinent social issue involving the young and the old alike. The answer to the puzzle/question of children earning more than their parents. This forms the basis of the data science problem for our project. We are setting out to investigate how household income affects earning power in the United States (US). We intend to follow the narrative track in solving this problem and produce an interactive article with insights gleaned from datasets on income distribution and college level characteristics from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) and College Scoreboard. The goal of this data analysis project is to obtain in-depth understanding on how the household income in the US affects the types of colleges people attend. It would also shed light on questions relating to how different categories of colleges affect earning power and ultimately, how they affect income mobility.

[1, 2] have characterized social mobility resulting from colleges in the United States. Chetty et al’s results have been reported by the New York Times [3] and APM Report [4] articles where the reader is provided interactive infographic using the data presented in [1]. The reader of the New York Times article provides a college into the infographic which returns related information comparing the entered college to peer institutions while also providing a scatter plot of parent incomes to graduates’ income at age 34. The article by APM Report provides a mouse hover chart using data source form the Brooking Institute to show discrepancies in family income between income percentiles. In addition, the APM Report also provides an infographic of students admitted at various universities as a function of parents’ income over time.  

We hope that our work (which will be presented as an interactive article) will help policymakers to understand how disparities in earning potential is fostered by the kinds of universities that people attend. The universities that people get to attend do not necessarily depend on their academic potential alone, it is also largely influenced by their household income. We hope that stakeholders, including universities will be informed by our work and thus, seek ways to ensure that income mobility propensities are common across tertiary institutions. It is also our expectation that the general public will be better informed about how income mobility is defined by educational institutions. This information can, thus, help them make the best decisions for their financial future. As our work analyses only how household income and the universities attended affects future income, information about how other factors contribute to future income may not be contained therein.
